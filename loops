    # Problem Statement:
    # The provided code stub reads an integer, n, from STDIN.
    # For all non-negative integers i < n, print i^2.

    # Read the integer from standard input
    n = int(input())
    
    # Loop through all non-negative integers less than n
    for i in range(n):
        # Print the square of the current integer
        print(i * i)
