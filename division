    # Problem Statement:
    # The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.
    # Add logic to print two lines:
    # 1. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b.
    # 2. The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.

    # Read the first integer from standard input
    a = int(input())
    
    # Read the second integer from standard input
    b = int(input())
    
    # Print the result of integer division
    print(a // b)
    
    # Print the result of float division
    print(a / b)
