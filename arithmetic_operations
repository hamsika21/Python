    # Problem Statement:
    # The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b.
    # Add code to print three lines where:
    # 1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
    # 2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
    # 3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

    # Read the first integer from standard input
    a = int(input())
    
    # Read the second integer from standard input
    b = int(input())
    
    # Print the sum of the two numbers
    print(a + b)
    
    # Print the difference of the two numbers (first - second)
    print(a - b)
    
    # Print the product of the two numbers
    print(a * b)
