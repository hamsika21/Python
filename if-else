    # Problem Statement:
    # Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:
    # - If n is odd, print "Weird"
    # - If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print "Not Weird"
    # - If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print "Weird"
    # - If n is even and greater than 20, print "Not Weird"
    
    n = int(input().strip())
    
    # Ensure n is within the valid range
    if n < 1 or n > 100:
        print("n should be between 1 and 100")
    else:
        # Check if n is odd
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print("Weird")
        # Check if n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5
        elif 2 <= n <= 5:
            print("Not Weird")
        # Check if n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20
        elif 6 <= n <= 20:
